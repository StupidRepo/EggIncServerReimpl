## `AuthenticatedMessage`s
Make a `hash.go` with this function:
- `HashV1(data: bytes) -> hex string of hash`
## Contracts 'n' stuff

Apparently, contracts/coop-related stuff uses a different hashing function.
In the previously mentioned `hash.go`, make this function:
- `HashV2(data: bytes) -> hex string of hash`
