## `AuthenticatedMessage`s
Make a `hash.py` with this function:
- `hash_v1(data: bytes) -> hex string of hash`
## Contracts 'n' stuff

Apparently, contracts/coop-related stuff uses a different hashing function.
In the previously mentioned `hash.py`, make this function:
- `hash_v2(data: bytes) -> hex string of hash`
